            <h2>Popular SDLC Models</h2>
            <p>There are numerous SDLC models, each with its unique advantages. Here are five widely recognized ones:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Waterfall Model:</strong> A straightforward, linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.</li>
                <li><strong>Agile Model:</strong> An iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Iterative Model:</strong> Allows for repeated cycles of development, gradually refining the software.</li>
                <li><strong>Spiral Model:</strong> Combines iterative development with risk analysis at every phase.</li>
                <li><strong>V-Shaped Model:</strong> A sequential model that emphasizes verification and validation at each development stage.</li>
            </ol>
